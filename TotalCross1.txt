The logic behind this resolution:
First we need to establish that, for every symbol, there is only 1 other symbol that decreases it.
For example: "X" and "V" are both only decreased by "I".
"M" and "D" are both only decreased by "C".
After establishing that, it is very simple.
We turn the num string into an char array.
Go through this array checking if the last symbol is the one that decreases.
If it is the one that decreases we add to the total the value of the symbol we are in - (2 * the value of the decreasing symbol) to the result.
Than just return the result and it's done.
