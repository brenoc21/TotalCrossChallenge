My logic behind this challange will be hard to explain.
Basically, you just need de highest power of each prime number.
For example, if the imput is 4:
1, 2, 3, 4|2
1, 1, 3, 2|2
1, 1, 3, 1|3
1, 1, 1, 1|/ (2^2) * 3

My point is: if the 2 wasn't there, i would make no difference at all.
Same if i had a 9, or a 16, etc.
So i divide each number in decrescent order for other numbers in crescent order from 2 to n.
I had to use BigInteger, because other types couldn't handle the number size.
