My logic behind this resolution:
This one is very simlar to the previous one.
We use the same logic to get the highest power of each number.
But this time we organize in this format:
if its power is > 1 : PrimeNumber + "^" + ItsPower.
If its power is = 1 : PrimeNumber.
We put it all together and we have the result string.
