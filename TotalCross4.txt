My logic behind this resolution:
We add all the fractions results to a List of doubles.
Create a counter to register the number of simplified fractions.
Then we go through the fraction list comparing each fraction to those that came before.
If a fraction result is equal to any result of the fractions before, it isn't simplified, 
so, we stop the comparisons and go to the next fraction.
If it isn't equal to those that came before, we add +1 to the counter.
After this comparisons we have our result.
